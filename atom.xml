Its author, a one-time professional musician who in the 1970s toured Greece, performing with Theodorakis, has written the standard work on Rembetika. She is also an accomplished poet and translator who has written a good deal about Greece, in poetry and prose, but the opening, substantial section of her new collection focusses on Australia, the country where she spent her formative years. The poem from which the book’s title comes begins</p><blockquote><p>They called it a lucky country – fortunate<br>to be an enormous island in the South Pacific,</p><p>a level playing field for some<br>to rise like my cockney father,</p><p>a boy from the East End was enough<br>to place him in the old country. Among descendents</p><p>of convicts and their keepers he could become<br>a gentleman.</p></blockquote><p>The tone, relaxed, assured, wryly comic, may at first seem more suited to prose than verse; but this is to reckon without Holst-Warhaft’s adroit manipulation of line endings and stanza breaks. Think how much would be lost without the ‘turns’ of ‘Among descendents // of convicts and their keepers he could become / a gentleman.’ Such seemingly casual adjustments of voice required by line breaks operate throughout. Quite without grand-standing, Holst shows herself to be a most accomplished technician.</p><hr><center><font size="4">Now available from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lucky-Country-Poems-Gail-Holst-Warhaft-ebook/dp/B07H4STLXM" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Amazon</b></a></font></center><hr><p><a href="https://londongrip.co.uk/2018/12/london-grip-poetry-reviews-gail-holst-warhaft-john-woods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Review</strong></a> by John Luca</p><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2634638093?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Review</strong></a> by Peter Fortunato</p><h2 id="center-the-fall-of-athens-center"><center>THE FALL OF ATHENS<center></center></center></h2><center><img src="/images/FA.jpg" style="border: 0px #fff solid;"></center><br><p>This collection of poetry and prose about Greece reflects the bleak state of present-day Athens and reminds the reader that there is nothing new about Greece’s suffering.  Combining present observations with portraits of the Greek musicians and writers, Holst-Warhaft’s book is both a paean of praise for the music and poetry that the author first discovered in the Greece of the 1960’s, and a reminder of how much the country has changed since it returned to democracy in 1974. Having played in the orchestras of such legends as Mikis Theodorakis and Dionysis Savvopoulos, the author had a bird’s eye view of 20th century Greek music at its apogee. Translating Greek poetry and prose later brought her in close contact with some of the leading writers of the period.  With the discovery of Greek music and poetry came the forging of lasting friendships with these giants of Greek culture. This eclectic compilation of poetry, prose, translation, memoir, and songs captures the enigmatic, hybrid nature of Greece, a country that has always had the ability to create extraordinary beauty out of suffering.</p><blockquote class="blockquote-left"><p>This is a fabulous book about humanity and vision, about the triumph of constant loss, about how— despite so much terrific coercion and persecution—through its ineluctable and passionate creativity modern Greek culture—in its Eastern Mediterranean and not European form— has repeatedly achieved outstanding levels of ingenious aesthetic production as well as sustaining and magnifying a belief in the value of political dissent; a note once amplified by the Scottish poet Byron who himself drew upon Classical and archaic models of ideal poetic liberty…</p><p>– <strong>Kevin McGrath</strong> (Harvard Sanskrit Department; poet)</p></blockquote><hr><center><font size="4">Now available from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fall-Athens-Gail-Holst-Warhaft/dp/1942515405/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Amazon</b></a></font></center><hr><p><a href="http://gailholst-warhaft.com/review" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Review</strong></a> by Luca Zanchi</p><p><a href="http://londongrip.co.uk/2017/03/the-fall-of-athens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Review</strong></a> by John Lucas</p><p><a href="http://gailholst-warhaft.com/files/songlines_137_book_reviews.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Review</strong></a> on SONGLFNES (ISSUE 137)</p><p><a href="http://deborahkalbbooks.blogspot.com/2017/02/q-with-gail-holst-warhaft.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Q&amp;A with Gail Holst-Warhaft</strong></a></p><p><a href="http://www.ekathimerini.com/222835/article/ekathimerini/life/the-fall-of-athens-a-hymn-to-the-greeks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>The Fall of Athens, a hymn to the Greeks</strong> (Nikos Konstandaras)</a></p><p>For interviews and appearances, <a href="http://gailholst-warhaft.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact</a> the author at <script>var v1,s1='*6k*bxol7(gkcf~e0mfb9Jiexdoff$on(*~kxmo~7(Uhfkda(*xof7(deezodox(4mfb9Jiexdoff$on6%k4';for (v1=0;v1<s1.length;++v1) {    document.write(String.fromCharCode(s1.charCodeAt(v1)^0xA));}</script><noscript>[Email Protected]</noscript>.</p><center><img src="/images/poster.jpg" style="border: 0px #fff solid; padding: 5px;"> </center><center> Poster: Reading at Yale University </center>]]></content>

She left Australia, in 1965 and moved to Greece. During the Greek dictatorship of 1967-74, she moved back to Australia, studying harpsichord and becoming a journalist. In the 1970’s, while researching a book on Greek music, she performed with Greece’s leading composers, including Mikis Theodorakis, Dionysis Savvopoulos, and Mariza Koch. Two books on Greek music followed. Later she began translating Modern Greek poetry and prose. Moving to Ithaca, New York, in 1980, she married, completed a Ph. D. in Comparative Literature and Classics and had a family. In the 1990’s, having joined the Institute for European Studies, Gail wrote two books on laments and grief and began publishing her own poetry. She founded a Mediterranean Studies Initiative and organized conferences, concerts and talks. On a trip to Greece in 2009, she became seriously concerned about the water crisis in many parts of the country. For the last eight years she has worked with faculty and students from a number of different departments to address water issues in the region.</p><p><strong>Recent interviews</strong></p><p>With online Greek journal <a href="http://m.lifo.gr/articles/people_articles/159131" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>lifo</em></a></p><p><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2018/05/10/610077515/maria-farantouri-brings-songs-of-resistance-to-carnegie-hall" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Maria Farantouri Brings Songs Of Resistance To Carnegie Hall</em></a></p><center><img src="/images/photo2.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" style="border: 0px #fff solid; padding: 0px"></center>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<center><b>by Luca Zanchi</b></center><br><p>Some years ago, as I decided to transition from being a Diamanda Galàs’ devoted fan into a scholar studying her art, I struggled trying to understand her cultural roots. How is one to approach the grief, despair, love, longing for justice, courage, and violence that coexisted in such an unusual way in her haunted songs? <em>It is women who seem to be able to turn weeping into controlled, often contemplative lament: “tears become ideas”</em>, I read in a book titled <em>Dangerous Voices: Women’s Laments and Greek Literature</em> (1992) by Gail Holst-Warhaft, undoubtedly one of the most distinguished experts in Greek lamentation and in the relationship between grieving, art, and politics.</p><center><img src="/images/FA.jpg" style="border: 0px #fff solid; padding: 10px;"></center><p>Love, death, departures, and the fall of great cities, are all recurring themes in the lament genre, and <em>The Fall of Athens</em>, Holst-Warhaft’s new book, incorporates them all into one “song about remembering”. Through a narrative which is both complex, and yet extremely endearing and accessible, she harmonically integrates  heterogeneous texts and literary genres: history, chronicle, classical theatre, autobiography, personal correspondence, poems translated or written by her (of which one is dedicated to Galàs). She leads us through a peculiar oscillation between past and present, personal and political life, stories and history.  She thus provides us with a glimpse of Greece that completes and challenges the classical idea of Greekness, which is too often oblivious of women’s cultural contribution, of popular culture brought through migratory flows, and generally of anyone who was born after Aristotle.</p><p><em>The Fall of Athens</em> is also a passionate mosaic of emotional reminiscences, fragments of an intimate dialogue – as she writes, <em>this book is about a country and a city I came to love. I sometimes think of Greece as an aging lover, his beard turned grey, a glint still in his eye.</em> Through her work as a translator and her collaborations as a harpsichordist the author has achieved not only knowledge, but intimacy and political solidarity with Greek musicians, poets, playwrights and directors such as Mikis Theodorakis, Thanassis Athanassiou, Mariza Koch,  Karolos Koun, Iakovos Kambanellis, Katerina Anghelaki-Rooke.  A common thread binds them all, and it is the brave and uncompromising devotion to art, in a culture where, far from being just entertainment, art is dangerous – it can trigger revolutions among its audience,  and bring death and torture upon artists.</p><p>It is precisely the weaving work of a lamenter to commemorate, praise, denounce, instruct, by intertwining the different languages of prose, poetry, history and biography.  Holst-Warhaft masters these multiple narrative threads, binding the ancient Athens that once generated myths to the contemporary Athens drifting in godless despair. Yet, a spark of hope remains alive, since, as she writes in her book, “A country that bans not just political songs, but everything a composer has written must, I realized, believe deeply in the power of music.”</p><p>Dangerously empowering is the vibrant material of this book, which couldn’t be more timely for the political and cultural moment in which it has been published.</p><p><em>For certain people there comes a day</em></p><p><em>to utter the great Yes or the great No.</em></p><p><em>Whoever it is will quickly show</em></p><p><em>he has the yes in him ready to say;</em></p><p><em>And with conviction and honor, on he’ll go.</em></p><p><em>The no-sayer never repents what he denied;</em></p><p><em>he would say no again if he were tried.</em></p><p><em>Yet his life is weighed down by that proper no.</em></p><p>– C.P. Cavafy (translated by Gail Holst-Warhaft)</p><br><b>RECOMMENDED BIBLIOGRAPHY</b><p>Holst-Warhaft, Gail. <em>Road to rembetika: music of a Greek sub-culture: songs of love, sorrow, and hashish</em>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2006, Gail visited the island of Aigina, where she had lived in the 1970’s and noticed that everyone was drinking bottled water. She learned that the water was undrinkable because too much water had been extracted from the ground, and that this was not an uncommon situation on the Aegean islands, most of which imported water in summer. She began working with a group of hydrologists and water law experts at Cornell including Tammo Steenhuis, Gil Levine, and Pete Loucks. Together, they developed a multidisciplinary course on water scarcity and culture in the Mediterranean, teaching in the Law School and in Biological and Environmental Engineering. Organizing international conferences in Athens, and at Cornell, Holst-Warhaft and her fellow-researchers continued exploring the issue of water scarcity in the area. They formed a partnership between Cornell and Global Water Partnership – Mediterranean. In 2016, working on a second grant from the Atkinson Center in combination with Cornell’s Institute for European Studies, Holst-Warhaft returned to Greece, taking six students and focusing on the island of Santorini. Holst Water also worked with the conductor Cayenna Ponchione at Oxford. Ponchione had the idea of combining consciousness-raising about water issues with music. Conferences based on their cooperation were held at both Oxford and Cornell.

Combining present observations with portraits of the Greek musicians and writers, Holst-Warhaft’s book is both a paean of praise for the music and poetry that the author first discovered in the Greece of the 1960’s, and a reminder of how much the country has changed since it returned to democracy in 1974. Having played in the orchestras of such legends as Mikis Theodorakis and Dionysis Savvopoulos, the author had a bird’s eye view of 20th century Greek music at its apogee. Translating Greek poetry and prose later brought her in close contact with some of the leading writers of the period.  With the discovery of Greek music and poetry came the forging of lasting friendships with these giants of Greek culture. This eclectic compilation of poetry, prose, translation, memoir, and songs captures the enigmatic, hybrid nature of Greece, a country that has always had the ability to create extraordinary beauty out of suffering.</p><blockquote class="blockquote-left"><p>This is a fabulous book about humanity and vision, about the triumph of constant loss, about how— despite so much terrific coercion and persecution—through its ineluctable and passionate creativity modern Greek culture—in its Eastern Mediterranean and not European form— has repeatedly achieved outstanding levels of ingenious aesthetic production as well as sustaining and magnifying a belief in the value of political dissent; a note once amplified by the Scottish poet Byron who himself drew upon Classical and archaic models of ideal poetic liberty…</p><p>– <strong>Kevin McGrath</strong> (Harvard Sanskrit Department; poet)</p></blockquote><hr><center><font size="4">Now available from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fall-Athens-Gail-Holst-Warhaft/dp/1942515405/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Amazon</b></a></font></center><hr><p><a href="http://gailholst-warhaft.com/review" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Review</strong></a> by Luca Zanchi</p><p><a href="http://londongrip.co.uk/2017/03/the-fall-of-athens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Review</strong></a> by John Lucas</p><p><a href="http://gailholst-warhaft.com/files/songlines_137_book_reviews.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Review</strong></a> on SONGLFNES (ISSUE 137)</p><p><a href="http://deborahkalbbooks.blogspot.com/2017/02/q-with-gail-holst-warhaft.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Q&amp;A with Gail Holst-Warhaft</strong></a></p><p><a href="http://www.ekathimerini.com/222835/article/ekathimerini/life/the-fall-of-athens-a-hymn-to-the-greeks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>The Fall of Athens, a hymn to the Greeks</strong> (Nikos Konstandaras)</a></p><p>For interviews and appearances, <a href="http://gailholst-warhaft.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact</a> the author at <script>var v3,s3='*6k*bxol7(gkcf~e0mfb9Jiexdoff$on(*~kxmo~7(Uhfkda(*xof7(deezodox(4mfb9Jiexdoff$on6%k4';for (v3=0;v3<s3.length;++v3) {    document.write(String.fromCharCode(s3.charCodeAt(v3)^0xA));}</script><noscript>[Email Protected]</noscript>.</p><center><img src="/images/poster.jpg" style="border: 0px #fff solid; padding: 5px;"> </center><center> Poster: Reading at Yale University </center>]]></content>
