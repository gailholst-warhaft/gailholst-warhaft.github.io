Above all, this is music to be danced to, and as the book reveals, it is the dancers who call the tune.</p><p>The songs tell of the sea and those that engage in often dangerous sea trades, of love and of pretty girls, sometimes of historical events, but also of sadness and separation, of women who wait in fear for their husbands and sons to return from long voyages or faraway lands. Most of the songs are not very old and many probably date no earlier than the late 18th or early 19th century, although they borrow musical and poetic motifs from older forms of Greek folk song. The most common instrumental accompaniment to them is the violin, often played together with a laouto, or folk lute, but the bagpipes and the santouri, or hammered dulcimer, are also popular.</p><p>Like the <em>rembetika</em>, the songs of underground and urban Greece, the nisiotika only became pan-Greek music after the islanders emigrated, initially to the US and then later to Athens, when their songs were recorded and where a wider audience for their music was created.</p><p>Combining research by pioneering musicologists and her own research into recordings, the songs themselves and through interviews, Gail Holst-Warhaft has turned the same discerning and loving eye on this subject as she did in her now classic book on rembetika, Road to <em>Rembetika</em>.</p><p>The text is illustrated with many photographs and includes a collection of the songs in Greek with English translation <em>en face</em>.</p><p>For videos for Nisiotika songs and dances, click <a href="https://gailholst-warhaft.com/nisiotika-links/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><h2 id="center-forthcoming-books-center"><center>Forthcoming books</center></h2><ul><li><p>Το μπαγλαμαδάκι που ήξερε να κάνει τα πικρά γλυκά Μια διαδρομή στο ρεμπέτικο για μικρούς και μεγάλους.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<center><img src="/images/photo3.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" style="border: 0px #fff solid; padding: 0px"></center><br>As well as being a poet, Gail Holst-Warhaft has been a journalist, broadcaster, prose-writer, academic, musician, and translator. She left Australia, in 1965 and moved to Greece. During the Greek dictatorship of 1967-74, she moved back to Australia, studying harpsichord and becoming a journalist. In the 1970’s, while researching a book on Greek music, she performed with Greece’s leading composers, including Mikis Theodorakis, Dionysis Savvopoulos, and Mariza Koch. Two books on Greek music followed. Later she began translating Modern Greek poetry and prose. Moving to Ithaca, New York, in 1980, she married, completed a Ph. D. in Comparative Literature and Classics and had a family. In the 1990’s, having joined the Institute for European Studies, Gail wrote two books on laments and grief and began publishing her own poetry. She founded a Mediterranean Studies Initiative and organized conferences, concerts and talks. On a trip to Greece in 2009, she became seriously concerned about the water crisis in many parts of the country. For the last eight years she has worked with faculty and students from a number of different departments to address water issues in the region.<h2 id="center-recent-interviews-center"><center>Recent interviews</center></h2><p>With <a href="https://www.ieidiseis.gr/politismos/126867/gail-holst-warhaft-mia-gennimeni-ellinida" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>iEidisis</em></a></p><p>With <a href="https://app.ertflix.gr/vod/vod.177255-monogramma-35" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Monogramma</em></a></p><p>With online Greek journal <a href="http://m.lifo.gr/articles/people_articles/159131" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>lifo</em></a></p><p><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2018/05/10/610077515/maria-farantouri-brings-songs-of-resistance-to-carnegie-hall" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Maria Farantouri Brings Songs Of Resistance To Carnegie Hall</em></a></p><h2 id="center-recent-events-center"><center>Recent events</center></h2><ul><li><p>May 6, 2021, Two readings in Ithaca’s  Spring Writes Festival.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZJWABS_3es" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watch Here</a></p></li><li><p>February, 2021, “Odysseys”: a series of virtual readings by Ithaca-based writers.<br><a href="https://ithacacityofasylum.org/2021/01/31/ithaca-writers-share-their-journeys-in-odysseys-reading-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read More</a></p><p><a href="http://gailholst-warhaft.com/events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See More Events</a></p></li></ul><center><img src="/images/photo2.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" style="border: 0px #fff solid; padding: 0px"></center>]]></content>

    <title>The Fall of Athens Book Review</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<center><b>by Luca Zanchi</b></center><br><p>Some years ago, as I decided to transition from being a Diamanda Galàs’ devoted fan into a scholar studying her art, I struggled trying to understand her cultural roots. How is one to approach the grief, despair, love, longing for justice, courage, and violence that coexisted in such an unusual way in her haunted songs? <em>It is women who seem to be able to turn weeping into controlled, often contemplative lament: “tears become ideas”</em>, I read in a book titled <em>Dangerous Voices: Women’s Laments and Greek Literature</em> (1992) by Gail Holst-Warhaft, undoubtedly one of the most distinguished experts in Greek lamentation and in the relationship between grieving, art, and politics.</p><center><img src="/images/FA.jpg" style="border: 0px #fff solid; padding: 10px;"></center><p>Love, death, departures, and the fall of great cities, are all recurring themes in the lament genre, and <em>The Fall of Athens</em>, Holst-Warhaft’s new book, incorporates them all into one “song about remembering”. Through a narrative which is both complex, and yet extremely endearing and accessible, she harmonically integrates  heterogeneous texts and literary genres: history, chronicle, classical theatre, autobiography, personal correspondence, poems translated or written by her (of which one is dedicated to Galàs). She leads us through a peculiar oscillation between past and present, personal and political life, stories and history.  She thus provides us with a glimpse of Greece that completes and challenges the classical idea of Greekness, which is too often oblivious of women’s cultural contribution, of popular culture brought through migratory flows, and generally of anyone who was born after Aristotle.</p><p><em>The Fall of Athens</em> is also a passionate mosaic of emotional reminiscences, fragments of an intimate dialogue – as she writes, <em>this book is about a country and a city I came to love. I sometimes think of Greece as an aging lover, his beard turned grey, a glint still in his eye.</em> Through her work as a translator and her collaborations as a harpsichordist the author has achieved not only knowledge, but intimacy and political solidarity with Greek musicians, poets, playwrights and directors such as Mikis Theodorakis, Thanassis Athanassiou, Mariza Koch,  Karolos Koun, Iakovos Kambanellis, Katerina Anghelaki-Rooke.  A common thread binds them all, and it is the brave and uncompromising devotion to art, in a culture where, far from being just entertainment, art is dangerous – it can trigger revolutions among its audience,  and bring death and torture upon artists.</p><p>It is precisely the weaving work of a lamenter to commemorate, praise, denounce, instruct, by intertwining the different languages of prose, poetry, history and biography.  Holst-Warhaft masters these multiple narrative threads, binding the ancient Athens that once generated myths to the contemporary Athens drifting in godless despair. Yet, a spark of hope remains alive, since, as she writes in her book, “A country that bans not just political songs, but everything a composer has written must, I realized, believe deeply in the power of music.”</p><p>Dangerously empowering is the vibrant material of this book, which couldn’t be more timely for the political and cultural moment in which it has been published.</p><p><em>For certain people there comes a day</em></p><p><em>to utter the great Yes or the great No.</em></p><p><em>Whoever it is will quickly show</em></p><p><em>he has the yes in him ready to say;</em></p><p><em>And with conviction and honor, on he’ll go.</em></p><p><em>The no-sayer never repents what he denied;</em></p><p><em>he would say no again if he were tried.</em></p><p><em>Yet his life is weighed down by that proper no.</em></p><p>– C.P.

Its author, a one-time professional musician who in the 1970s toured Greece, performing with Theodorakis, has written the standard work on Rembetika.

The poem from which the book’s title comes begins</p><blockquote><p>They called it a lucky country – fortunate<br>to be an enormous island in the South Pacific,</p><p>a level playing field for some<br>to rise like my cockney father,</p><p>a boy from the East End was enough<br>to place him in the old country. Among descendents</p><p>of convicts and their keepers he could become<br>a gentleman.</p></blockquote><p>The tone, relaxed, assured, wryly comic, may at first seem more suited to prose than verse; but this is to reckon without Holst-Warhaft’s adroit manipulation of line endings and stanza breaks. Think how much would be lost without the ‘turns’ of ‘Among descendents // of convicts and their keepers he could become / a gentleman.’ Such seemingly casual adjustments of voice required by line breaks operate throughout. Quite without grand-standing, Holst shows herself to be a most accomplished technician.</p><hr><center><font size="4">Available from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lucky-Country-Poems-Gail-Holst-Warhaft-ebook/dp/B07H4STLXM" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Amazon</b></a></font></center><hr><p><a href="https://londongrip.co.uk/2018/12/london-grip-poetry-reviews-gail-holst-warhaft-john-woods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Review</strong></a> by John Luca</p><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2634638093?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Review</strong></a> by Peter Fortunato</p><p><a href="http://outofboundsradioshow.com/exc_audio_post/gail-holst-warhaft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>The Out of Bounds Radio Show with Tish Pearlman</strong></a></p><h2 id="two-poems-for-chana-bloch">Two poems for Chana Bloch</h2><p>In <em>Shofar</em> 36.2, 2018.

Above all, this is music to be danced to, and as the book reveals, it is the dancers who call the tune.</p><p>The songs tell of the sea and those that engage in often dangerous sea trades, of love and of pretty girls, sometimes of historical events, but also of sadness and separation, of women who wait in fear for their husbands and sons to return from long voyages or faraway lands. Most of the songs are not very old and many probably date no earlier than the late 18th or early 19th century, although they borrow musical and poetic motifs from older forms of Greek folk song. The most common instrumental accompaniment to them is the violin, often played together with a laouto, or folk lute, but the bagpipes and the santouri, or hammered dulcimer, are also popular.</p><p>Like the <em>rembetika</em>, the songs of underground and urban Greece, the nisiotika only became pan-Greek music after the islanders emigrated, initially to the US and then later to Athens, when their songs were recorded and where a wider audience for their music was created.</p><p>Combining research by pioneering musicologists and her own research into recordings, the songs themselves and through interviews, Gail Holst-Warhaft has turned the same discerning and loving eye on this subject as she did in her now classic book on rembetika, Road to <em>Rembetika</em>.</p><p>The text is illustrated with many photographs and includes a collection of the songs in Greek with English translation <em>en face</em>.</p><p>For videos for Nisiotika songs and dances, click <a href="https://gailholst-warhaft.com/nisiotika-links/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><h2 id="ένα-ταξίδι-στο-ρεμπέτικο-για-μικρούς-και-μεγάλους-a-journey-into-the-rembetika-for-young-and-old">Ένα ταξίδι στο ρεμπέτικο για μικρούς και μεγάλους (A Journey into the Rembetika for Young and Old)</h2><center><img src="/images/music/rembetiko_cover.jpeg" width="60%" style="float: center; border: 0px #fff solid; "></center><center><img src="/images/music/rembetiko_back.jpeg" width="60%" style="float: center; border: 0px #fff solid;"></center><center><img align="center" src="/images/music/rembetiko01.jpg" width="60%" style="border: 0px #fff solid; "></center><center><img align="center" src="/images/music/rembetiko02.jpg" width="60%" style="border: 0px #fff solid; "></center><br>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2006, Gail visited the island of Aigina, where she had lived in the 1970’s and noticed that everyone was drinking bottled water. She learned that the water was undrinkable because too much water had been extracted from the ground, and that this was not an uncommon situation on the Aegean islands, most of which imported water in summer. She began working with a group of hydrologists and water law experts at Cornell including Tammo Steenhuis, Gil Levine, and Pete Loucks. Together, they developed a multidisciplinary course on water scarcity and culture in the Mediterranean, teaching in the Law School and in Biological and Environmental Engineering. Organizing international conferences in Athens, and at Cornell, Holst-Warhaft and her fellow-researchers continued exploring the issue of water scarcity in the area. They formed a partnership between Cornell and Global Water Partnership – Mediterranean. In 2016, working on a second grant from the Atkinson Center in combination with Cornell’s Institute for European Studies, Holst-Warhaft returned to Greece, taking six students and focusing on the island of Santorini. Holst Water also worked with the conductor Cayenna Ponchione at Oxford. Ponchione had the idea of combining consciousness-raising about water issues with music. Conferences based on their cooperation were held at both Oxford and Cornell.

He is the country’s most famous composer, and a figure who has spent his life struggling against injustice and oppression in his own country and elsewhere. He has been jailed and tortured for his beliefs, continuing to produce a stream of music and poetry despite his suffering. It is time that his own poetry was recognized as an important element in his creative life.  In an age where Bob Dylan can win a Nobel Prize, and Leonard Cohen’s lyrics are treasured as poems, it is also time to recognize the importance of the song-lyric as a literary form. Gail Holst-Warhaft, who has spent many years working with the composer as a musician, biographer and translator, has translated all of the composer’s lyrics and combined them with Theodorakis’s virtually unknown poems. Together, they reveal a man whose passion for poetry was the wellspring of his creativity. The book presents Theodorakis’s poems and lyrics in Greek and English. This makes it clear that the translations do not obey the rhyme-scheme of the originals but try to maintain rhythmic patterns that are satisfying to the English ear. This book is not only a collection of Theodorakis’s poetry, but the record of an extraordinary life.</p><hr><center><font size="4">Now available from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/House-Scorpions-Selected-Song-Lyrics-Theodorakis/dp/1947917137" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Amazon</b></a></font></center><hr><h4 id="about-the-author">About the Author</h4><p>When someone asked Mikis Theodorakis where he got his inspiration for his music, he answered: “It’s very simple. I never thought of my music as anything but a way to clothe Greek poetry.”  Theodorakis is known to the world as a composer. To the English-speaking world, unfortunately, he is known principally for his film scores, particularly the score of Zorba the Greek, and a few of his popular songs. To the Greeks, Theodorakis is the man who combined the greatest poetry of their country with his own prodigious melodic gifts to create a river of unforgettable songs. Few think of him as a poet, and yet he wrote fine poems, some of which became the lyrics of his songs.</p><h4 id="mikis-theodorakis-obituary">Mikis Theodorakis Obituary</h4><p>Composer Mikis Theodorakis dies, September 2, 2021, aged 96.

Combining present observations with portraits of the Greek musicians and writers, Holst-Warhaft’s book is both a paean of praise for the music and poetry that the author first discovered in the Greece of the 1960’s, and a reminder of how much the country has changed since it returned to democracy in 1974. Having played in the orchestras of such legends as Mikis Theodorakis and Dionysis Savvopoulos, the author had a bird’s eye view of 20th century Greek music at its apogee. Translating Greek poetry and prose later brought her in close contact with some of the leading writers of the period.  With the discovery of Greek music and poetry came the forging of lasting friendships with these giants of Greek culture. This eclectic compilation of poetry, prose, translation, memoir, and songs captures the enigmatic, hybrid nature of Greece, a country that has always had the ability to create extraordinary beauty out of suffering.</p><blockquote class="blockquote-left"><p>This is a fabulous book about humanity and vision, about the triumph of constant loss, about how— despite so much terrific coercion and persecution—through its ineluctable and passionate creativity modern Greek culture—in its Eastern Mediterranean and not European form— has repeatedly achieved outstanding levels of ingenious aesthetic production as well as sustaining and magnifying a belief in the value of political dissent; a note once amplified by the Scottish poet Byron who himself drew upon Classical and archaic models of ideal poetic liberty…</p><p>– <strong>Kevin McGrath</strong> (Harvard Sanskrit Department; poet)</p></blockquote><hr><center><font size="4">Now available from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fall-Athens-Gail-Holst-Warhaft/dp/1942515405/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Amazon</b></a></font></center><hr><p><a href="http://gailholst-warhaft.com/review" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Review</strong></a> by Luca Zanchi</p><p><a href="http://londongrip.co.uk/2017/03/the-fall-of-athens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Review</strong></a> by John Lucas</p><p><a href="http://gailholst-warhaft.com/files/songlines_137_book_reviews.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Review</strong></a> on SONGLFNES (ISSUE 137)</p><p><a href="http://deborahkalbbooks.blogspot.com/2017/02/q-with-gail-holst-warhaft.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Q&amp;A with Gail Holst-Warhaft</strong></a></p><p><a href="http://www.ekathimerini.com/222835/article/ekathimerini/life/the-fall-of-athens-a-hymn-to-the-greeks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>The Fall of Athens, a hymn to the Greeks</strong> (Nikos Konstandaras)</a></p><p>For interviews and appearances, <a href="http://gailholst-warhaft.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact</a> the author at <script>var v5,s5='*6k*bxol7(gkcf~e0mfb9Jiexdoff$on(*~kxmo~7(Uhfkda(*xof7(deezodox(4mfb9Jiexdoff$on6%k4';for (v5=0;v5<s5.length;++v5) {    document.write(String.fromCharCode(s5.charCodeAt(v5)^0xA));}</script><noscript>[Email Protected]</noscript>.</p><center><img src="/images/poster.jpg" style="border: 0px #fff solid; padding: 5px;"> </center><center> Poster: Reading at Yale University </center>]]></content>
